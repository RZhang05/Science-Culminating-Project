## How Common?

`1.5 - 5` percent of the general population has or will develop a cerebral aneurysm. About `3 - 5 million` people in the U.S. have cerebral aneurysms, although, most not producing symptoms. `0.5 - 3 percent` of people with brain aneurysm will suffer from bleeding.

## How do they happen?

Most are usually not born with aneurysms, but are developed after the age of 40.

They usually develop at *branching points* of **arteries**, and are caused by constant pressure from blood flow.

Can also be assiciated with other type of blood vessel disorders.

May run in families, but are rarely born with aneurysm. The normal occurences happen through infections, drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine that damage the brain's blood vessels, or direct brain trauma from an accident.

Large | *16mm - 25mm* | Fusiform | Spindle shaped, without a distinct neck
Giant | Larger than *25mm* | --- | ---

### Location

Major Arteries in brain structures. During surgery, normal brain tissue must be carefully spread apart to expose it. Can occur in the front part of the brain, or the back part of the brain.
